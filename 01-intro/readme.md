## Introduction to React Exercise

For this assignment you will be creating three components

1. FirstComponent which is an `h1` with the text "My very first component"
2. SecondComponent which is an `h2` with the text "My second component"
3. NamedComponent which is a `p` that should accept a property of "name" and display the text "My name is " + name. Research `props` and how you can dynamically pass properties to your components

All of your components should be created with pure JavaScript and HTML.
