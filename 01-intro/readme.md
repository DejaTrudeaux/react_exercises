## Introduction to React Exercise

### Part 1

For this assignment you will be creating three components:

1. `FirstComponent`, which is an `h1` with the text "My very first component."
2. `SecondComponent`, which is an `h2` with the text "My second component."
3. `NamedComponent`, which is a `p` that should accept a property of "name" and display the text "My name is " + name. 

All of your components should be created with pure JavaScript and HTML.

### Part 2

1. Define a `Tweet` component which takes as props the username of the user who wrote the tweet, the name of the user who wrote the tweet, the date of the tweet, and the message being tweeted.
2. Create an `App` component that renders at least three tweets.
3. Style your `Tweet` component!
