## Introduction to React Exercise

For this assignment you will be creating three components:

1. `FirstComponent`, which is an `h1` with the text "My very first component."
2. `SecondComponent`, which is an `h2` with the text "My second component."
3. `NamedComponent`, which is a `p` that should accept a property of "name" and display the text "My name is " + name. 

All of your components should be created with pure JavaScript and HTML.
