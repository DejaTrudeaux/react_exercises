## Component Lifecycle Exercise

### Part 1 

Rebuild the [Giphy API exercise](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/intermediate-javascript-part-2/ajax-exercises) with React.

### Part 2

Add another component to your Todo App called `EditTodoForm`, which renders a form to edit a todo. When the form is submitted, it should rename the todo's task. Depending on the UI which you choose, you may have to use a few lifecycle hooks to ensure that your application works as expected.


As a bonus, allow your todos to be marked as completed and as a super bonus, store your results in localStorage!
