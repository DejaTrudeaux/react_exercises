## Events Exercise

## Part 1

With your previous Todo App, create another component called `NewTodoForm` which should render a form that when submitted, will create a new `Todo`. It is up to you to decide where you would like to contain the state of the todos, but think about this design before you start implenting it!

You should also add a button to all of your todos with the value of "X". When this button is clicked, the todo should be removed from the page and from the todos array.
