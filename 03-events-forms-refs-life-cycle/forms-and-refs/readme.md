## Forms and Refs Exercises

## Part 1

Let's revisit our `Todo` app from the events chapter. Create another component called `NewTodoForm` which should render a form that, when submitted, will create a new Todo. 

## Part 2

Create an app with a form that lets you add `divs` to the page. Inside of the form you should be able to specify the `div`'s width, height, and background color. When you submit the form, the div should show up on the page with the specified style, and the first input on the form should come in to focus.
